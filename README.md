# ExpressionParser
A JavaScript boolean/mathematical expression parser

This is yet another tool I original created for use with my [grid widget](https://github.com/mosbymc/HTML-Data-Grid-Widget) but have since decided to create a new repository for itself. Intended future functionality will be for this tool to be able to parse any mathematical and/or boolean expression and determine the truth value for either the entire tree, or for any given node within the tree. I also plan on allowing the truth to be determined while the parsing/tokenizing is occurring, or later; in either case, allowing the context within which to evaluate the truth to be specified. Eventually, and we're talking way down the road, but I may include visualization of the expression as a tree.

As with my other spin-off repos, my main focus right now is with the grid; until that starts to wind down, there most likely won't be much progress made here.
